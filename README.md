# Nannou sketches n stuff 🦀

This is me learning Rust + Nannou to hopefully be able to make good use of the pen plotter I've just recently received :0

## To run this thang 🏃‍♀️💨

1. Be up to snuff with Nannou's [getting started section](https://guide.nannou.cc/getting_started/platform-specific_setup.html) and have Rust installed.
2. clone the repo and `cd` into it
3. `cargo run`
4. oooo and ahhhh
